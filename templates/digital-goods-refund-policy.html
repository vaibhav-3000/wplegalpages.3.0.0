<p>We offer refunds on purchase of our digital goods. However, since we deal with digital goods, we honor requests for refunds for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Non-delivery of the product: Due to an issue with the mail, you do not receive a delivery e-mail from us. Depending on the price of the product, [Domain] may require you to first submit proof that you have submitted a report to the mail service describing the missing item;</p>
<p>Download issues: You have problems that prevent you from downloading the product. [Domain] recommends that you contact the support team for your browser provider, as [Domain] ensures that our software can be downloaded with all major browsers, and this problem usually arises from a customer's issue with either their browser, firewall, or network;</p>
<p>Irreparable defects with the software: Although all the products are thoroughly tested before release, unexpected errors may occur. This reason should be submitted to our Support Team for its approval of your refund request;</p>
<p>Product not-as-described: A request based on this reason is addressed on a case-by-case basis and subject to our approval. To prevent this kind of claim from arising, every customer is encouraged to check free samples ( in the form of video overviews, demo links, product samples, screen shots) of each type of the product offered before making a purchase.</p>
